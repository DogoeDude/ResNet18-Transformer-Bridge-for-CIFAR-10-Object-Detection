# Architecture-Fusion-1

The CIFAR-10 dataset can be downloaded(https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) for local usage or directly from torchvision datasets.

1. What you fused:
    We fused a CNN backbone (ResNet-18) with a Transformer encoder.
    The CNN extracts local spatial features from images.
    The Transformer encodes long-range dependencies across feature maps to capture global contextual information.

2. Why you fused them:
    CNN alone is good at capturing local patterns but limited in modeling global relationships across the image.
    Transformer is excellent at global reasoning but inefficient for raw pixel inputs.
    Fusion allows CNN to extract features efficiently, and Transformer to model relationships across those features, improving classification performance on datasets where both local and global information matter.

3. Expected improvement / behavior:
    Better accuracy on classification tasks, especially when objects are small, occluded, or require global context.
    More robust feature representation combining local texture and global structure.

4. Problem being solved:
    Image classification on CIFAR-10, which involves correctly classifying 32x32 RGB images into 10 categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, etc.).

5. Why it is relevant:
    CIFAR-10 is a standard benchmark for evaluating image classification architectures.
    Demonstrates the effectiveness of architecture fusion strategies, which are relevant for modern vision tasks (e.g., medical imaging, remote sensing, small-object detection).

6. Source, size, sample images:
    Dataset: CIFAR-10, from torchvision datasets.
    Size: 60,000 images total (50,000 train, 10,000 test), 32x32 pixels, 3 channels (RGB).
    Sample images: Airplanes, cats, dogs, trucks, etc.

7. Architectures used
    CNN Backbone: ResNet-18 (pretrained optional).
    Transformer Module: 2 layers of TransformerEncoder with 8 attention heads, operating on the flattened CNN feature map sequences.
    Classifier head: Global average pooling → Linear layer → Softmax (for 10 classes).

8. Explanation of the fusion strategy:
    Input image → CNN (ResNet-18) → extracts a feature map [B, C, H, W].
    Apply 1x1 convolution to reduce feature dimension (e.g., 512 → 256).
    Flatten spatial dimensions → sequence [B, H*W, C] for Transformer input.
    Transformer encoder applies multi-head self-attention to learn dependencies between spatial locations.
    Global average pooling across sequence dimensions → feed into classification head.
    This allows the network to combine local CNN features with global attention from the Transformer.

9. Preprocessing and training details:
    Transforms: Resize to 64x64, random horizontal flips, normalization (0.5,0.5,0.5).
    Batch size: 64
    Optimizer: AdamW, learning rate 1e-4
    Epochs: 5–10 (for demonstration)
    Loss: Cross-entropy

10. What your fusion contributed:
        What worked:
            Captured both local and global features.
            Achieved slightly higher accuracy than baseline CNN in experiments.
        What didn’t work / limitations:
            Overhead from Transformer layers increased training time.
            Small image size (32x32) limits the benefit of Transformers; may require upscaling.
            Limited epochs and simple data augmentation may cap performance.
